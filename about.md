    <p class="motto">
    A new musical instrument may not change the meaning of improvisation, but it will surely change how a talented musician improvises. Similarly, new toys and tools for modeling, prototyping, and simulation may not change the meaning of innovation, but they will surely change how organizations innovate. – Michael Schrage
